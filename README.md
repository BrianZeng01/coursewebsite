<h4>Week 1</h4>
Questions: <br>
1.) How is the readability, coding conventions, and such? <br>
2.) For the google sign-in, when signed in and upon revisting the page the prompt to sign in flashes for a second before changing to the signout message. What is the work-around for this delay? <br>
3.) Am I going to need to create an html file for each individual course? <br>
