            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p> This privacy policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) describes how the personally identifiable information
                (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) you may provide on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
                    href="https://www.coursecritics.ca">coursecritics.ca</a> website (&quot;Website&quot; or
                &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its related products and services (collectively,
                &quot;Services&quot;) is collected, protected and used. It also describes the choices available to
                you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this
                information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (&quot;User&quot;,
                &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) and this Website operator (&quot;Operator&quot;,
                &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). By accessing and using the Website and Services,
                you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this
                Agreement. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control,
                or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
            <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
            <p>Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We may
                process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Website
                and Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse
                and establish statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services.
                This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any
                particular user of the system.</p>
            <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
            <p>You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any
                information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however,
                you wish to use some of the features on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal
                Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you
                knowingly provide to us when you publish content, or fill any online forms on the Website. When
                required, this information may include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.</li>
                <li>Any other materials you willingly submit to us such as articles, images, feedback, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to
                take advantage of some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what
                information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>
            <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
            <p>In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to
                collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request,
                we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Some of the information
                we collect is directly from you via the Website and Services. However, we may also collect Personal
                Information about you from other sources. Any of the information we collect from you may be used to
                help us run and operate the Website and Services.</p>
            <p>
                Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services,
                where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your
                consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
                Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is
                necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations
                thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are
                subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the
                legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</p>
            <p> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal
                bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or
                contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
            <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
            <p> Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any
                service you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third
                parties that work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the
                operation of the Website and Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with
                unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your
                information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.
                We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy
                policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal
                Information. These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform
                their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for
                their own marketing or other purposes.</p>
            <h2>Retention of information</h2>
            <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
                obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is
                required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
                Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you
                personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the
                right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability
                cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
            <h2>The rights of users</h2>
            <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have
                the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously
                given your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the
                processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent;
                (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure
                regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing
                processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be
                updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the
                processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose
                other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure
                of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a
                structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it
                transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that
                your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent,
                on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p>
            <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are
                under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services.
                We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help
                enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the
                Website and Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the
                age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Website and Services, please contact
                us. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your Personal Information in your
                country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>The Website and Services use &quot;cookies&quot; to help personalize your online experience. A cookie
                is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
                programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be
                read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
            <p>We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate the
                Website and Services. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
                automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if
                you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features
                of the Website and Services. To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit <a
                    target="_blank" href="https://www.internetcookies.org">internetcookies.org</a></p>
            <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
            <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not
                want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting
                information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting
                personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as
                they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is
                not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to
                Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout
                this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.</p>
            <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
            <p>The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us.
                Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or
                third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and to read the
                privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>
            <h2>Information security</h2>
            <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected
                from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and
                physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and
                disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over
                the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your
                Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the
                Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all
                information and data exchanged between you and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and
                (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party,
                despite best efforts.</p>
            <h2>Data breach</h2>
            <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or
                users Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external
                activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take
                reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well
                as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach,
                we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a
                reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by
                law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Website.</p>
            <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the Website and Services from
                time to time in our discretion and will notify you of any material changes to the way in which we
                treat Personal Information. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of the Website.
                We may also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as through contact
                information you have provided. Any updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon
                the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and
                Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time)
                will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your
                Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal
                Information was collected. Policy was created with <a style="color:inherit" target="_blank"
