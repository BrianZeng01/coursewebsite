        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>Coursecritics is a platform created to assist students in course planning.
            It was created by students alike who found course planning to be a stressful task with
            little guidance. By creating a platform exclusively for reviewing courses it is our hope
            that students will know exactly what they're signing up for.</p>
